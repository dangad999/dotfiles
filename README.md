My Dotfiles Repo
------------------

This is my personal git repo for my dofiles I use on my computers.

Most stuff is from other repos and blog sites, but needed to put it somewhere as my local git server (raspberry pi) isnt very reliable.

## Installation

for linux:
`git clone git@github.com:daniel-gadd/dotfiles.git ~/.shell && ~/.shell/tools/install.sh`

## What is covered?

I Have the following config Files in this repo:
* i3wm
* tmux
* zsh
* terminal fonts

## Notes

Happy to have it cloned and push requests made, but please remember these are my personal dotfiles and I may (or may not) like some changes as I have a comfortable workflow. But Please share anything as its all open source.
